# Python Draw: Shinchan Image Pixel Analysis

This project demonstrates how to load, analyze, and display an image (Shinchan) using Python. It uses popular libraries such as Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas to process and visualize image data.

## Features

- Loads an image (`image.jpeg`) and displays it pixel-perfect using Matplotlib.
- Converts the image to a NumPy array for pixel manipulation.
- Creates a Pandas DataFrame containing pixel data (RGB or RGBA).
- Prints image shape and a preview of pixel data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas

Install dependencies with:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your image file as `image.jpeg` in the project directory.
2. Run the script:

```powershell
python main.py
```

3. The script will display the image and print pixel data in the console.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Main script for image loading, analysis, and display.
- `image.jpeg`: The image to be analyzed and displayed.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Example Output

- Console: Image shape and first few pixel values.
- Window: Pixel-perfect display of the Shinchan image.
